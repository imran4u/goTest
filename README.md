# To run multiple file of go in same package and directory
If you're using Go modules, check that your project is structured properly and that there are no issues with your build. In the project folder, try running:

``` go run . ```

Or explicitly specify both files:

``` go run main.go file1.go```

# To build with custome name

```go build -o <output_name> <source_file> ```
